## 🎨 Modern Developer Aesthetic

The entire CodeSync UI has been completely rebuilt to match modern developer-platform aesthetics (inspired by Linear, Vercel, and Render). 

- **Layered Dark Theme:** Rich deep background (`#0B0C10`) with elevated translucent surfaces and backdrop blur elements.
- **Premium Typography:** Clean hierarchy using **Space Grotesk** for headings and **Inter** for UI text.
- **Visual Depth:** Soft shadow elevations, subtle borders, and smooth card hover micro-interactions.
- **Split-Screen Auth:** Animated hero panel and clean form interface.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔧 High-Performance Architecture
- **Instant Navigation**: < 200ms transitions between views using route-based lazy loading and hover prefetching.
- **Fast Data Retrieval**: Optimized MongoDB access with `.lean()` queries and compound indexing on activity logs.
- **Efficient Delivery**: HTTP response compression enabled for reduced payload sizes and faster load times.
- **Visual Polish**: Shimmer skeleton loaders provide immediate feedback during data fetching.

### 💻 Elite Collaboration
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Powered by Monaco Editor with throttled cursor tracking and debounced code updates.
- **Activity Feed**: Intelligent sidebar and dashboard panel showing live user joins, file modifications, and role changes.
- **Universal Sync**: Instant synchronization of file creation, deletion, and renaming across all active clients.
- **Dynamic Presence**: Live user avatars with role-based ring indicators (Owner/Editor/Viewer).

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support
Generate workspaces in seconds with automated starter templates for 7 core languages:
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, Go, Rust.
- **Smart Templates**: Each workspace initializes with a standard entry file (e.g., `main.py`, `Main.java`) containing boilerplate code.

### 🛡️ Secure Workspace Governance
- **Role-Based Access (RBAC)**: Secure permission enforcement (Owner, Editor, Viewer).
- **Session Control**: Explicit "Leave Session" capability with automatic cleanup and real-time member list updates.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Requirements
- Node.js v16+
- MongoDB instance (Local or Atlas)

### 2. Setup Environment
**Backend (.env)**:
```env
PORT=3001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Frontend (.env.development)**:
```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Installation & Execution
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application is now live at `http://localhost:5173`.
